speaker1: So tell me about your process for picking a clinic project, what qualities were you looking for when you picked Competition Team?
speaker2: So Competition Team is a little bit different because sophomore year, you have to say, hey I'm interested in Competition Team. And then you have to be interviewed to see if you'd be a good fit. So what drew me to a school is like ours asked looked at another school and stuff like that is I wanted to be a part of building a competition 'thing'. That was a big thing for me. I've always loved Competition Team topic ever since growing up and now when I had that option. So sophomore year, I started to get into going to the cleanup days and stuff like that for sport and then kind of weaseled my way and got to know everybody. And then once I found out Teammate was going to be our team lead. I talked to them and said I was interested. And I said that I wanted to [do a specific task], which is what got me on X team. Awesome.
